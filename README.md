About
-----

A mini lua web app framework.  Lua is portugese for moon.  Buzz Aldrin
was the second man on the moon.  This is the second lua web server I
know of (see Xavante for the first).

At this point, I'm just messing around for my own education and
enjoyment.  Maybe it'll turn into something serious, but likely not.

Requirements
------------

Luajit.  I have only targeted and tested with 2.0.0 beta 

Mac OS X 10.7 - While it's entirely possible it work fine on many
Unix-like systems, there are several assumptions being made about
implementation specific details in socket.lua that are not guaranteed
to be true anywhere else.  This will get fixed eventually.

Installation
------------
	Nope.  Just run server.py with luajit.
