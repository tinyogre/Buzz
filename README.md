About
-----

A mini lua web server.  Lua is portugese for moon.  Buzz Aldrin was
the second man on the moon.  This is the second lua web server (see
Xavante for the first).

At this point, I'm just messing around for my own education and
enjoyment.  Maybe it'll turn into something serious, but likely not.

Requirements
------------
Luajit.  I have only targeted and tested with 2.0.0 beta

Installation
------------
	Nope.  Just run server.py with luajit.
