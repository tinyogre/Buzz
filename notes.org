* 1 
*** Parent Wispers project has development in 2010
* 2 
*** Single commit from non-primary developer, mostly 2010
* 3
*** No releases since 2010, but branches have activity in 2011 and parent Kepler project is active
* 4
*** Orbit is a complete MVC framework, orbit.htmlify is part of the main module.  It could probably be extracted without much difficulty, but not as simply as copying a file or directory
*** An app written for orbit could also easily use any of these other template libraries
* 5
*** HAML does let you embed actual HTML, but discourages it, and most HAML files will have little or no "normal" HTML
* 6
*** Looks a lot like Django, but isn't really.
* 7
*** Tir is a complete framework, but the view.lua module looks like it can be used by itself
